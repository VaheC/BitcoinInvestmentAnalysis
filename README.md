# Bitcoin Investment Analysis
The aim of the current project is to generate a useful recommendation on bitcoin investment while addressing the following points:

* How does the performance of Bitcoin compare to the S&P 500 and the price of gold?
* bitcoin's returns and volatility analysis
* Could it help improve the performance of a portfolio? 
* Could Bitcoin be used as a hedge versus inflation?
* a portfolio construction using bitcoin, S&P 500, and gold: make a recommendation that minimizes overall risk.
